Ion;A positively or negatively charged atom
Element;A substance that consists of only one type of atom and it cannot be broken down into anything simpler by chemical means
Atom;The smallest part of an element that can exist
Compound;A substance that contains two or more elements that are chemically combined
Mixture;Consists of two or more different substances, not chemically joined together
Covalent bonding;Forms when two non-metal atoms share a pair of electrons
Ionic bonding;When metals react with non-metals, electrons are transferred from the metal atoms to the non-metal atoms forming ions
Metallic bonding;The force of attraction between these free-moving electrons and positive metal ions
Delocalised electrons;Free-moving electrons
Group number;Number of valence electrons of the elements in a certain group
Period number;The number of electron occupied shells in the element
Nucleus;The very small and dense central part of an atom which contains protons and neutrons
Proton;A tiny positive particle found inside the nucleus of an atom.
Electron;A tiny particle with a negative charge. Electrons orbit the nucleus in atoms or ions
Neutron;A dense particle found in the nucleus of an atom. It is electrically neutral. They have no overall charge
Atomic number;The number of protons (which equals the number of electrons) in an atom
Mass number;The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom
Group;All the elements in each column (labelled 1 to 8) down the Periodic table
Inert;Unreactive
Isotope; Atom that has the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons
Molecular formula;The chemical formula that shows the actual numbers of atoms in a particular molecule
Periodic table;An arrangement of elements in the order of their atomic numbers forming groups and periods.
